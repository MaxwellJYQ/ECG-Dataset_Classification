# ECG-Dataset_Classification

# ECG Heartbeat Classification Task

This project focuses on classifying ECG (electrocardiogram) data using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The project utilizes various models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and other advanced deep learning methods, to improve the accuracy and efficiency of classification.

## Project Introduction

The goal of this project is to analyze and process ECG data, using machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify ECG signals, thereby aiding in the detection and diagnosis of arrhythmias and other heart conditions.
